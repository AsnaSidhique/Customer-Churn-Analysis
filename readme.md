# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer behavior at a telecom company to predict churn using machine learning models.

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: Telco-Customer-Churn.csv
- Target variable: `Churn`

## ✅ Key Steps

1. Data Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Encoding  
4. Train/Test Split  
5. Logistic Regression & Decision Tree Models  
6. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

## 📊 EDA Insights

- Month-to-month contracts have high churn.
- Fiber optic internet users churn more than DSL users.
- Higher monthly charges = higher chance of churn.

## 🤖 Models Used
